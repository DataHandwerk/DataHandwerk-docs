= Persistence generator

IMPORTANT: The procedure xref:sqldb:repo.usp_persistence_set.adoc[] is not called automatically. If a persistence is to be created or changed, this must be done manually!

IMPORTANT: Before you execute the procedure xref:sqldb:repo.usp_persistence_set.adoc[], check, if the persistence source should have a real or virtual PK. Some persistence actions are not available, if no PK is defined in the source. Execute xref:sqldb:repo.usp_Index_virtual_set[] to define virtual PK, whenever this is possible.

* This will insert new required entries into xref:sqldb:repo.RepoObjectColumn.adoc[]. 
* It will update properties for entries of existing target columns
* It will not delete entries for columns in the persistence target, which have been added to the persistence table definition (it is possible to have additional columns, for example calculated columns or just additional columns to input some data independently from the source)

In order for the persistence to be updated correctly, one (or sometimes two) execution(s) of xref:sqldb:repo.usp_main.adoc[] are required:

* the new or changed columns have to be synchronized between DWH and repo
* xref:sqldb:repo.RepoObjectColumn.adoc#column-RepoObjectColumn_column_id[repo.RepoObjectColumn.RepoObjectColumn_column_id] must get a value, this happens depending on the fulfilled prerequisites already in the first or only in the second pass

The SQL code for the persistence target table is located in xref:sqldb:repo.RepoObject_SqlCreateTable.adoc#column-SqlCreateTable[repo.RepoObject_SqlCreateTable.SqlCreateTable]

IMPORTANT: A change script is not yet created! You need to compare the generated code and the existing code.

TIP: You could use the generated code in a Visual Studio database project and deploy it to the database using Schema compare.

DataHandwerk provides the code for a persistence stored procedure for each managed persistence. The code of this procedure will change depending on

* the columns of the persistence source
* settings in xref:sqldb:repo.RepoObject_persistence.adoc[]

The code is available in xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp_SqlUsp.adoc#column-SqlUsp[uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp_SqlUsp.SqlUsp]

[WARNING] 
--
Currently it could be tricky to rename columns in persistence source and to promote this into the target. The target could be used. It still needs some testing and investigation to suggest the best practice. It looks like you sould:

* start to change the source
* then EXEC repo.[usp_persistence_set]
* check [repo].[RepoObjectColumn_gross]
* exec [repo].[usp_main]
* check [repo].[RepoObjectColumn_gross]
* maybe you need edit the content of the column [persistence_source_RepoObjectColumn_guid]
* todo: improve the usp

// New source columns have been added for persistence source. Why are these columns not updated in 
// [repo].[RepoObject_SqlCreateTable].[SqlCreateTable]?

// Columns are defined in [repo].[RepoObject_ColumnList].CreateColumnList

// [repo].[usp_persistence_set] 



// New columns have been added for a persistence target. And why they are not included into 



// by the persistence?


// In order for the persistence procedure to be updated correctly, several executions of [repo].[usp_main] are required:

// * die neuen Spalten m√ºssen zwischen DWH und Repo synchronisiert werden
// * [RepoObjectColumn_column_id] muss einen Wert bekommen, das passiert erst im zweiten Durchlauf

=== error in usp_id;Number;Parent_Number: 19;310; (SQL Server bug in system views)

Executing [repo].[usp_main], I get this error:

UPDATE repo.RepoObjectColumn

LEFT OUTER JOIN [repo].[RepoObject] [ro]

....


the issue is related to `[repo_sys].[RepoObjectReferenced]`

there is a bug in SQL Server, and somtimes the usage of this system procedure causes an error:

....
FROM repo.RepoObject AS ro
CROSS APPLY sys_dwh.dm_sql_referenced_entities(SysObject_fullname, 'OBJECT') AS referenced
WHERE ISNULL([ro].[has_get_referenced_issue], 0) = 0
....

That's why we use `[ro].[has_get_referenced_issue]`

it is required to find out the problematic RepoObject and to set +
`repo.RepoObject.[has_get_referenced_issue] = 1`


Lets check the error message

#The dependencies reported for entity "*[repo].[ftv_RepoObject_ReferenceTree]*" might not include references to all columns.# This is either because the entity references an object that does not exist or because of an error in one or more statements in the entity.  Before rerunning the query, ensure that there are no errors in the entity and that all objects referenced by the entity exist.

Before rerunning the query, ensure that there are no errors in the entity and that all objects referenced by the entity exist.

we will mark these RepoObject

[source,sql]
....
UPDATE [repo].[RepoObject]
SET [has_get_referenced_issue] = 1
WHERE [RepoObject_fullname] IN (
  '[repo].[ftv_RepoObject_ReferenceTree]'
  , '[repo].[RepoObject_ReferenceTree]'
  )
....

let's check:

[source,sql]
....
SELECT
*
FROM [repo_sys].[RepoObjectReferenced]
ORDER BY [RepoObject_fullname]
....

Maybe you need to exclude more objects, until the view will work again.



// Experiment with TOP X in the following query to find out the objects causing the error

// [source,sql]
// ....
// SELECT 
// TOP 2000
// [RepoObject_guid]
//       ,[RepoObject_fullname]
//       ,[SysObject_id]
//       ,[SysObject_type]
//       ,[SysObject_modify_date]
//       ,[is_repo_managed]
//       ,[has_different_sys_names]
//       ,[SysObject_fullname]
//       ,[referencing_minor_id]
//       ,[referenced_server_name]
//       ,[referenced_database_name]
//       ,[referenced_schema_name]
//       ,[referenced_entity_name]
//       ,[referenced_minor_name]
//       ,[referenced_id]
//       ,[referenced_minor_id]
//       ,[referenced_class]
//       ,[referenced_class_desc]
//       ,[is_caller_dependent]
//       ,[is_ambiguous]
//       ,[is_selected]
//       ,[is_updated]
//       ,[is_select_all]
//       ,[is_all_columns_found]
//       ,[is_insert_all]
//       ,[is_incomplete]
//   FROM [repo_sys].[RepoObjectReferenced]
//   order by [RepoObject_fullname]
// ....

// For example Top 627 is OK, Top 628 causes an error

// When using Top 627, what is the last [RepoObject_fullname]?

// In my case it is: [repo].[ftv_RepoObject_DbmlColumnRelation]

// Now lets check in [repo].[RepoObject], which RepoObject is the following one:

// [source,sql]
// ....
// SELECT [RepoObject_guid]
//  , [RepoObject_fullname]
// FROM [repo].[RepoObject]
// ORDER BY [RepoObject_fullname]
// ....


=== How to add columns to graph tables and use them as a target of a persistence?

I want to use a graph table as persistence target. I created a source view containing the required structure. But now I want to add a column to the source and to the source. Visual Studio Schema compare can't create valid SQL because I use restrictions. What should I do?

Use TSQl to add columns:

[source,sql]
....
ALTER TABLE [graph].[RepoObject]
ADD RepoObject_fullname2 nvarchar(257) NULL;

ALTER TABLE [graph].[RepoObjectColumn]
ADD 
RepoObject_fullname2 nvarchar(257) NULL,
 RepoObjectColumn_fullname2 nvarchar(386) NULL
;
....

Das funktioniert nicht, da es gerade bei graph tables Probleme gibt


in repo.RepoObject mark them as is_repo_managed = 0

Sie m√ºssen also is_repo_managed = 1 sein

und man muss die Spalten markieren, die null-bar sind.
