= SSMS configuration

Some views create code to be copied and executed. This requires that line breaks are preserved and the code is not truncated.

If SSMS is to be used, then some settings should be adjusted:

* Query Results > SQL Server > Results to Grid
** enable `Retain CR/LF on copy or save`
** `Maximum Characters Retrieved` > `Non XML data` - set a much higher value than default, for example `200000`
