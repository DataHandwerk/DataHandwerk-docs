= usp generator

A generator for the formalized definition of usp (user defined procedures) which use xref:manual:execution-log.adoc[].

If logging is to be used, then the code for logging is repeated several times. This can be simplified by separating the user code from the logging code. Logging can be switched on and off per procedure and per step.

usp generator procedures are defined in 3 tables:

* xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp.adoc[]
* xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUspParameter.adoc[]
* xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUspStep.adoc[]

A special case of the procedures created by the usp generator are the procedures for xref:manual:persistence-generator.adoc[]. These procedures are defined by the persistence settings in xref:sqldb:repo.RepoObject_persistence.adoc[].

The final code of the generated procedures is available in xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp_SqlUsp.adoc#column-SqlUsp[uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp_SqlUsp.SqlUsp]

TIP: If SSMS is used to retrieve the generated code, then the xref:manual:ssms-configuration.adoc[] should be checked and adjusted.

== Challenges when using the usp generator

=== multiline data

The entries in xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUspStep.adoc#column-Statement[uspgenerator.GeneratorUspStep.Statement] are usually multi-line. But SSMS and Azure Data Studio do not have usable support for multi-line data entry.

One possibility is to use the https://dbeaver.com/[DBeaver].

However, DBeaver does not currently allow new entries in tables with calculated columns. It is not possible to create new entries in xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUsp.adoc[]:

* https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/11900[mssql - it is not possible to insert new lines into tables containing calculated columns]

Other options would be:

* Microsoft Access
* https://www.openxava.org/[OpenXava]

=== refactoring

If refactoring is used to rename objects or columns, then the code of the procedures can be changed with it. However, since the code of the procedures is ultimately created by the definitions in xref:sqldb:uspgenerator.GeneratorUspStep.adoc[], these changes must primarily be entered there.
