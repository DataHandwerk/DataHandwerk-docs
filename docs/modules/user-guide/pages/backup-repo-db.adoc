= Backup and restore repository database

The repository database contains important data and should be backed up regularly.

== SQL Server backup

One simple way is to create SQL Server backups. However, the drives of the server on which the backups are created are often not shared. Secondly, a backup cannot be restored with an older version of SQL Server.

== Data-tier Applications - DACPAC and BACPAC

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/data-tier-applications?view=sql-server-ver15[Data-tier Applications]


BACPAC, which are created by an "export", cannot be created from the repository database, because a validation is mandatory before the creation. This validation fails because the database is connected to other databases via synonyms and refers to system objects.

However, it is possible to "extract" DACPAC with data if database validation is turned off in the process.

This is not possible in SSMS or Azure Data Studio. SSMS does not allow you to turn off validation. ADS has validation turned off, but does not allow creating DACPAC with data. Only BACPAC can be created with data.

The contents of a DACPAC can also be viewed (and extracted) with a program that can browse zip archives.

=== Create DACPAC with Visual Studio

It is possible to create a DACPAC with data using Visual Studio and disable validation. This works via the context menu of the "SQL Server Object Explorer".

=== Command Line - sqlpackage.exe

Alle oben genannten GUI verwenden letztendlich sqlpackage.exe, man kann dieses Programm also auch direkt verwenden.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-ver15[sqlpackage.exe]

sqlpackage can be downloaded from the Internet. However, it is usually already included one or more times on the developer's machine, since it is also provided with SSMS or the database projects for Visual Studio.

* `/Action:Extract` Creates a data-tier application (.dacpac) file containing the schema or schema and user data from a connected SQL database. (`Export` to create a BACPAC does not work!).
* `/p:ExtractAllTableData=TRUE` extracts the data of all tables
* `/Action:Publish` Incrementally updates a database schema to match the schema of a source .dacpac file. If the database does not exist on the server, the publish operation creates it. Otherwise, an existing database is updated.

It is necessary to prevent the extraction of the data of the graph tables, otherwise there will be problems with the recovery of the data. Instead of using `/p:ExtractAllTableData=TRUE`, one could list all tables individually, using `/p:TableData=(STRING)`. Alternatively, all data for all tables is extracted and the data for the graph tables is then manually deleted from DACPAC: 

If the data of the graph tables have already been extracted, then you can open the DACPAC like a ZIP archive and delete these data there.

=== deploy DACPAC including data

It is possible to restore the database including data using SSMS. When trying to restore data from graph tables, an error occurs. The error messages are more visible if `sqlpackage.exe` is used with `publish` action.

If the DACPAC contains data for graph tables using edge constraints, then the database data cannot be restored, because `TRUNCATE` is not allowed in this case. (This is a bug in sqlpackage.exe)

----
Updating database (Failed)
*** Could not deploy package.
Warning SQL72038: The object [readonly] already exists in database with a different definition and will not be altered.
Error SQL72014: .Net SqlClient Data Provider: Msg 13944, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 Cannot truncate table 'graph.RepoObject' because it is being referenced by an EDGE constraint.
Error SQL72045: Script execution error.  The executed script:
TRUNCATE TABLE [graph].[RepoObject];
----

If this error occurs (and it occurs when you extract all data of all tables, and there is content for graph tables), then the data of the tables in the schema `graph` must be deleted from DACPAC. See above.
